# Coursera-Assignments
The set of my Coursera Data Science Specialization homework assignments.

# How to Navigate this Repository
This repository will be structured to contain the individual assignments for each of the Data Science Specialization courses which contain applicable homework assignments. The files will be sorted into filepaths with "<Course Name>/<Week Number>" as the filepath to distinguish each individual assignment, and all data for each individual assignment should self-contained, even if files are duplicated accross assignments. For peer-graded assignments, a separate repository will be made that is a duplicate of the specified weekly assignment folder, which will later be archived or deleted entirely.

# Additional Information
If you're reading this and want to know more about the specific course, please feel free to visit the Data Science Specialization on Coursera at "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science".

These assignments are not to be duplicated for any reason and especially not for use in the JHU Data Science Specialization, regardless of if this repository is listed publicly.
